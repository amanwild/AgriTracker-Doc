### 1.4 Background and Problem Statement

#### 1.4.1 Background
Small-scale farmers in India face critical challenges:
* **Data Management**: Reliance on manual record-keeping limits ability to track crop yields, resource usage, and financial performance.
* **Market Access**: Dependence on middlemen reduces profit margins and creates information asymmetry.

**AgriTracker** addresses these issues by providing:
* **Data Management Tools**: Digital recording of farm operations (crop cycles, irrigation, inputs).
* **Direct Marketplace**: Platform for farmers to list produce and connect directly with buyers.
* **Blog Functionality**: Allows farmers to share their experiences, profits/losses, and best practices with the farming community.

#### 1.4.2 Problem Statement
The core problems are:
* **Data Inaccessibility**:
    * No centralized system for farm data analysis.
    * Manual methods hinder performance tracking.
* **Market Inefficiency**:
    * Middlemen dominate supply chains, reducing farmer profits.
    * Buyers lack transparency in pricing and produce availability.

### 1.5 Objectives

| Objective             | Description                                          | Success Metric                               |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Data-Driven Decisions** | Enable farmers to record and analyze crop/resource data | 80% adoption rate among pilot users          |
| **Market Linkage** | Facilitate direct farmer-buyer transactions          | 50% reduction in middlemen dependency        |
| **Sustainability** | Promote resource optimization                        | 30% improvement in water/fertilizer efficiency |

### 1.6 Scope

#### 1.6.1 In Scope
* **Farm Management Module**:
    * Crop cycle tracking
    * Resource (water, fertilizer) logging
    * Report generation (PDF/Excel)
* **Marketplace Module**:

    * Search/filter functionality for buyers
    * Communication tools (WhatsApp/phone integration)

#### 1.6.2 Out of Scope
* Online payment processing (Phase 2)
* Advanced predictive analytics (AI/ML)

### 1.7 Methodology
**AgriTracker** follows **Agile** development with these phases:
1.  **Requirement Gathering**: Farmer interviews (n=100+ across 5 states).
2.  **Prototyping**: Low-fidelity UI mockups validated with users.
3.  **Development**:
    * **Frontend**: Django-based responsive design
    * **Backend**: Python (Django REST Framework)
    * **Database**: PostgreSQL with encryption
4.  **Testing**:
    * **Unit testing** (`PyTest`)
    * **User acceptance testing (UAT)** with farmers
5.  **Deployment**: Gradual rollout to 500+ farms in Phase 1.

## 2. Overall Description
This section provides context and background for AgriTracker, outlining its key aspects, stakeholders, and the environment in which it will operate.

### 2.1 Product Perspective
**AgriTracker** is a standalone web-based platform built on `Django REST Framework` (backend) and a responsive front-end (`HTML/CSS/Bootstrap`) to support large and mid-scale farmers across India. It integrates three primary modulesâ€”**Farm Management**, **Marketplace**, and **Community Blog**â€”each communicating over secure RESTful APIs with a PostgreSQL database. External dependencies include WhatsApp Business API for messaging, SMTP for email notifications, and PDF/Excel reporting libraries. AgriTracker will be deployable on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS/GCP) or on-premises servers.

### 2.2 Product Functions
* **Farm Management Module**:
    * Record and track crop cycles, irrigation schedules, fertilizer and pesticide usage.
    * Generate performance reports (PDF/Excel) and interactive visualizations of yield vs. inputs.
    * Manage resource inventories and historical data analytics.
* **Marketplace Module**:
    * Create and manage crop listings with attributes (type, quantity, quality grade, harvest date, price).
    * Advanced search and filter for buyers by location, crop type, price range, and availability.
    * In-app messaging integration via WhatsApp and phone, plus buyer-seller negotiation logs.
* **Community Blog Module**:
    * Publish user-generated articles on best practices, profit/loss case studies, and crop management tips.
    * Comment and rating features for community feedback and knowledge sharing.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
* **Administrators**: Manage user accounts, moderate content, oversee system health and analytics; technical proficiency: high.
* **Farmers (Sellers)**: Primary users responsible for data entry, listing produce, and reading blog content; technical proficiency: low to moderate.
* **Buyers**: Search, filter, and purchase listings; moderate web literacy; authenticated via email/phone.
* **Support/Analysts**: Generate aggregate reports, respond to user queries, and maintain knowledge base; technical proficiency: moderate.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
* **Server**: Linux-based VM or container with Docker, minimum 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB storage.
* **Client**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) on desktops, tablets, and smartphones; responsive for 320Ã—568 to 1920Ã—1080 resolutions.
* **Network**: Internet connectivity with minimum 512 Kbps bandwidth; secure HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
* Must use `Django 4.x` and `Django REST Framework` for backend.
* `DBSqlite3` as the primary datastore; data encryption at rest.
* Front-end implemented with `Bootstrap 5`; comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
* Integration limited to WhatsApp Business API, SMTP, and PDF/Excel libraries with non-commercial licenses.
* All code developed in `Python 3.10+`; adhere to `PEP 8` and use `pytest` for TDD.

### 2.6 ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

#### 2.6.1 Data Flow Diagram
A DFD is a Pictorial representation used to visualize the flow of data for a system. It illustrates how data moves through various processes, data stores, and external entities. DFDs help in understanding the functional aspects of a system by mapping out data inputs, outputs, processing steps, and storage points.

#### 2.6.2 Notations Used
Notations in the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) include processes, data stores, data flows, and external entities, representing system functions, storage, data movement, and user interactions respectively. There are four basic symbols used to construct data flow diagram:
* A rectangle represents the source and destination.
* An arrow represents the flow of data.
* A circle or oval represents a system function.
* Two parallel lines represent a data store.

*Fig 2.6.1 Notations Use*

#### 2.6.3 Data Flow Diagram of Seller
*Fig 2.6.2 DFD for Seller*

#### 2.6.4 Data Flow Diagram for Buyer
*Fig: 2.6.3 Data Flow Diagram for Buyer*

#### 2.6.5 Sequence Diagram for Verification
*Fig 2.6.4 Sequence Diagram for Verification*

#### 2.6.6 Blog Management Use case Diagram
* Users can add, edit, and update blogs with details like name, description, image, and category.
* Blogs need verification before publishing, and they can be approved or rejected.
* Includes login and a "Request for Publish" step.

#### 2.6.7 Buyer-Seller Interaction
* Buyers can verify details and log in to interact with sellers.
* Communication happens via WhatsApp, email, or by visiting the system.
* Buyers can view posts shared by sellers (farmers).

#### 2.6.8 Login and Registration Process
* "Send OTP via Email" is the core use case, triggered when users need to verify their identity.
* **When OTP is Used**:
    * **Registration**: New users verify their email during sign-up.
    * **Login**: Secure access by confirming OTP (if enabled).
    * **Forget Password**: Users request an OTP to reset their password.
* **Steps Involved**: Send OTP â†’ Verify OTP â†’ (Proceed to reset password, register, or log in).
* **Who Uses It**: Farmers (Sellers) and Customers (Buyers)â€”both roles rely on OTP for secure authentication.

### 2.7 User Documentation
* **User Manual**: Step-by-step guide covering account setup, module usage, report generation, and marketplace workflows.
* **Online Help**: Contextual tooltips, FAQ section, and search-enabled knowledge base.
* **Tutorials**: Short video walkthroughs for mobile and web interfaces; hosted on YouTube or embedded player.
* **Release Notes**: Versioned change logs and known issues for each deployment.

### 2.8 Assumptions and Dependencies
* Farmers and buyers have basic literacy in English or Hindi and access to a smartphone or computer.
* Reliable internet access is available in target agricultural regions.
* WhatsApp Business API and SMTP services remain operational and within usage quotas.
* No real-time payment gateway integration in Phase 1.
